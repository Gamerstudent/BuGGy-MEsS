# BuGGy MeSS  
There is lore option inside the game to tell you about the lore,    
This is a survival game where you have to kill waves of innocent bugs.
I did mixing in this game got art from many places,I wrote and learnt so much code, I learnt about box-casting, delegates, coroutines, Gizmos etc   
it is fun to make this game, although if i didnt laze around i would have added more things on the front end,   
i actually planned to add procedurally generated levels into the game but i didn't because i wasted my time thinking i have so much time  
i animated with the given sprites it's not difficult.  
## CONTROLS  
use arrow keys to move, space bar to jump, C to crouch (i added crouch because i did animation for it and there is no practical use for it), left click to attack.  
Thats It. ### I CANT EVEN SAY ENJOY THE GAME AFTER SEEING THE FINAL PRODUCT, BUT I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE IT 0_0 .
